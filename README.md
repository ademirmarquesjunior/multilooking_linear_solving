Very high spatial resolution data seems to reach its maximum for orbital images due to unavoidable atmospheric interactions. At the same time, special hyperspectral cameras are being developed to operate on-board manned or unmanned aircrafts at a fixed optics, which prevents its using for imaging near objects in laboratory conditions. Both limitations can only be surpassed by using super-resolution principles. In this paper, we present a multi-looking approach for enhancing the spatial resolution of images acquired by systems that exhausted their natural ability to provide finer images. The method exploits multiple image takes with controlled spatial differences to produce a higher resolution output. Experiments with static hyperspectral sensor and synthetic data have proven the approach is sound and robust to many applications (e.g., rock samples).
